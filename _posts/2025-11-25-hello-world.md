Hi everyone, my name is Roshan. I like physics, AI, and neuroscience. Though most of my academic/professional experience is in hardware design, I am always thinking of personally interesting experiments and think software would be a cool way to take a stab at some of them. I'm new to GitHub and programming in general, so excuse any obvious mistakes :) Hope you find the posts interesting, and you can contact me at roshan dot wariar at gmail dot com if you'd like to chat!

Outside of technical work, I enjoy watching films (neo-noir, sci-fi), listening to/making music (post-punk, indie rock, experimental), and cooking cuisines from a variety of different cultures. Check out my band Soupboys on streaming!
