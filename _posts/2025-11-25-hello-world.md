Welcome to my blog! Here I'll be exploring topics at the intersection of computation.

## What to Expect

- **Statistical Physics**: Phase transitions, information theory, and thermodynamics
- **Hardware Design**: Circuit design, FPGA, and embedded systems
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Neural networks and computational neuroscience
- **Neuroscience**: Brain computation and biologically-inspired algorithms

This is your first post. Replace this content with your own.

## Adding Images

Place images in `assets/images/` and reference them with:
