Recently, I read a couple of papers that have touched on a similar topic. Does the use of reinforcement learning with verifable rewards (RLVR) after pre-training and instruction fine-tuning really help the model string together novel reasoning traces that are otherwise not present in the base model's distribution? That is what this year's NeurIPS Best Paper Award runner-up tries to answer. [1]  Simply, their conclusion is _no_. They say, "our findings reveal that current RLVR does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns; instead, the reasoning capabilities of RLVR-trained models remain bounded by those of their base models." By looking at pass@k metrics for high k values across a variety of smaller lanaguage models on popular reasoning benchmarks, their conclusion is that RLVR simply trades off diversity for single-shot accuracy (ie exploration vs. exploitation - or more efficient sampling of the "correct" chain-of-thought).<br>
